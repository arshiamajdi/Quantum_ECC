How to Set Up and Run a Python Script with External Libraries Using a Virtual Environment on Mac (M1)

Step 1: Open Terminal

Open the Terminal app from Applications > Utilities or by searching "Terminal" in Spotlight.

Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Folder

Use the `cd` command to go to the folder where your Python script is located. For example:

cd "/Users/arshiamajdi/Documents/MY_PERSONAL_PROJECTS/python project/Qrcode"

Make sure the folder contains your `qr_code.py` file.

Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment

Run this command to create a virtual environment using Python 3.12:

/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12 -m venv qr_env

This creates a folder called `qr_env` that contains an isolated Python setup.

Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment

Run this command to activate the virtual environment:

source qr_env/bin/activate

Your terminal prompt will now start with `(qr_env)` to indicate that the environment is active.

Step 5: Install Required Libraries

With the virtual environment active, install the necessary packages:

pip install pyqrcode pypng

This installs the `pyqrcode` and `pypng` libraries into your virtual environment.

Step 6: Run the Python Script

Now run your Python script:

python qr_code.py

If everything is set up correctly, the script will generate two files in your folder:

- myqr.svg
- myqr.png

These files are the QR codes that the script created.

Step 7: (Optional) Add Confirmation Output

To make sure the script runs visibly, you can add this line at the end of `qr_code.py`:

print("QR code generated successfully!")

Then rerun the script:

python qr_code.py

You should see the message in the terminal.

Step 8: Deactivate the Virtual Environment (Optional)

When you’re done working, you can deactivate the environment by typing:

deactivate

This returns your terminal to the regular system Python environment.
